# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients, where the generated gradient does not display as expected.

The solution involves ensuring that all necessary Tailwind CSS directives are correctly configured and that the gradient definition is valid within the Tailwind configuration.

## Reproduction
